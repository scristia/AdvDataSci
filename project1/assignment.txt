Submission requirements

Your report must be no longer than 4 pages ( <= 2,000 words) with 3 display
items. You may include up to 2 pages of supplementary equations/description.
Your report must be in the form of a pdf. You must also submit R code to perform
your analyses (in the form of a .Rmd file). The R code must run in under 2 hours
start to finish. Remember to include your username and the accuracy values you
were returned from Google.

** Reproducibility **

Your reproducibility score will be determined by whether your code can be run
without error and produces all numbers/figures in your main text. Please include
library requirements at the beginning of your script and an estimate of the
approximate runtime. Comments are not required, but I will only try to fix code
that is liberally and accurately commented.
